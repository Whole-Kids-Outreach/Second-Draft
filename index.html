<p> Welcome to Whole Kids Outreach (WKO) and the corner of the world in which we serve.

WKO is nestled in the beautiful, heavily forested Ozarks of south central Missouri. Many of the families served by WKO are tucked away in the hills and often are isolated from the resources that they need to meet their family’s needs. There are no other comprehensive service organizations for pregnant women/teen and families with young children like Whole Kids Outreach in the six-county area.

Statistically, the area served by Whole Kids Outreach is among the most impoverished and least healthy regions of the State. The population density of the region is about 12 people per square mile, which leaves many families both geographically and socially isolated. Living in such a vast rural area with few resources (for example, there is only one grocery store in all of Reynolds County) compounds the challenges of access to needed services and resources which help make families with young children healthy.

Whole Kids Outreach serves its families by providing home visiting and center-based programs.  Together the wide array of service activities helps families to learn the skills they need to raise healthy, happy and successful children.

Our mission is clear—daily, we improve the health of women and children and decrease child abuse and neglect. I invite you to look through our website further and learn more about WKO. Please contact me or any of our staff if you need more information about services we offer or if you are interested in helping the wonderful families of our region.

Blessings,
Sister Anne Francioni, SSND, RN, MA
